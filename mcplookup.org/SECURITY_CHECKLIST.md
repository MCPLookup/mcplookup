- [ ] **Update deployment docs** - Include security considerations
- [ ] **Create incident response plan** - For future security issues

## üöÄ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

### **1. Team Notification (URGENT)**
```bash
# Send this message to all team members:
üö® SECURITY INCIDENT RESOLVED - ACTION REQUIRED

Git repository has been cleaned of exposed credentials.

IMMEDIATE ACTION:
1. DELETE your local mcplookup.org folder
2. RE-CLONE: git clone https://github.com/TSavo/mcplookup.org.git
3. DO NOT push from old clones

Repository is now secure for development.
```

### **2. Production Environment Updates**
- [ ] **Verify new credentials** work in production
- [ ] **Update Vercel environment variables**
- [ ] **Test application functionality**
- [ ] **Monitor for any issues**

### **3. Security Hardening**
```bash
# Fix remaining issues:
npm audit fix --force  # Fix dependency vulnerabilities
./scripts/security-audit.sh  # Run security scan
```

## üîç **SECURITY MONITORING**

### **Daily Checks**
- [ ] Monitor Upstash Redis logs for unusual activity
- [ ] Check application logs for security events
- [ ] Verify no new secrets committed

### **Weekly Tasks**
- [ ] Run security audit script
- [ ] Update dependencies
- [ ] Review access logs

### **Monthly Reviews**
- [ ] Full security assessment
- [ ] Update security documentation
- [ ] Review and rotate credentials
