# üö® Security Incident Response - Exposed Credentials

**Date**: 2025-06-04  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: ACTIVE RESPONSE  

## üìã Incident Summary

**What Happened**: Real Upstash Redis credentials were accidentally committed to the git repository and exposed in documentation files.

**Exposed Credentials**:
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`: `REDACTED_TOKEN`
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`: `https://your-database.upstash.io`

**Files Affected**:
- `SECURITY.md` (multiple instances)
- Git history (multiple commits)

**Impact**: 
- Production Redis database potentially accessible to anyone with repository access
- Risk of data breach, service disruption, or unauthorized access

## üöÄ Immediate Response Actions

### ‚úÖ **STEP 1: Credential Rotation (URGENT)**

**Action**: Immediately rotate exposed credentials in Upstash console

1. **Login to Upstash Console**: https://console.upstash.com/
2. **Navigate to Redis Database**: `your-database-name`
3. **Regenerate REST Token**:
   - Go to "Details" tab
   - Click "Regenerate Token" 
   - Copy new token
4. **Update Production Environment**:
   - Vercel: Update `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` in environment variables
   - Any other deployments: Update environment variables

**Timeline**: Complete within 1 hour of discovery

### ‚úÖ **STEP 2: Clean Current Files**

**Action**: Remove exposed credentials from current repository files

Files cleaned:
- [x] `SECURITY.md` - Replaced real credentials with placeholders

### üîÑ **STEP 3: Git History Scrubbing (IN PROGRESS)**

**Action**: Remove credentials from entire git history

**Script Created**: `scripts/scrub-git-history.sh`

**Options Available**:
1. **BFG Repo-Cleaner** (Recommended)
2. **git filter-repo** (Modern alternative)  
3. **git filter-branch** (Legacy)

**Commands to Execute**:
```bash
# Run the scrubbing script
./scripts/scrub-git-history.sh

# Verify scrubbing worked
git log --oneline -p --all | grep -i "REDACTED_TOKEN" || echo "Clean!"

# Force push (DESTRUCTIVE - notify team first)
git push --force --all
git push --force --tags
```

### üì¢ **STEP 4: Team Notification**

**Action**: Notify all team members about the incident and required actions

**Message Template**:
```
üö® SECURITY INCIDENT - Action Required

We discovered exposed Redis credentials in our git repository. 

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Credentials have been rotated in Upstash
2. We will force-push a cleaned git history
3. You MUST re-clone the repository after the force push

TIMELINE:
- Credential rotation: Complete
- Git history scrub: In progress  
- Force push: [PENDING - will notify]

Please do not push any changes until the all-clear is given.
```

### üîç **STEP 5: Impact Assessment**

**Questions to Investigate**:
- [ ] When were the credentials first committed?
- [ ] How long were they exposed?
- [ ] Who had access to the repository?
- [ ] Any suspicious activity in Upstash logs?
- [ ] Any unauthorized Redis connections?

**Upstash Monitoring**:
1. Check connection logs for unusual activity
2. Review data access patterns
3. Monitor for any unauthorized operations

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention Measures

### **Immediate Safeguards**:
- [x] Add comprehensive `.gitignore` for environment files
- [x] Create environment setup script with placeholders
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks to scan for secrets
- [ ] Implement automated secret scanning in CI/CD

### **Long-term Security Enhancements**:
- [ ] Implement proper secret management (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- [ ] Add security training for all developers
- [ ] Regular security audits of repository
- [ ] Automated dependency vulnerability scanning

| 2025-06-04 12:00 | Force push to remote | ‚è≥ Pending |
| 2025-06-04 12:30 | Team notification | ‚è≥ Pending |

## üéØ Success Criteria

- [x] No credentials visible in current repository files
- [ ] No credentials found in git history
- [ ] New credentials active in production
- [ ] All team members notified and repositories re-cloned
- [ ] No unauthorized access detected in logs

## üìû Emergency Contacts

- **Repository Owner**: TSavo
- **Security Team**: [Add contacts]
- **Upstash Support**: support@upstash.com

## üìù Lessons Learned

**What Went Wrong**:
- Real credentials were used in documentation examples
- No automated secret scanning in place
- Insufficient developer training on secret management

**What Went Right**:
- Quick discovery and response
- Comprehensive cleanup plan
- Good environment variable separation already in place

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Implement automated secret scanning
- [ ] Add security training to onboarding
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks for secret detection
