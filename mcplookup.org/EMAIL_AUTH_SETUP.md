## üêõ **Troubleshooting**

### **Email Not Sending**
```bash
# Check environment variables
echo $EMAIL_HOST
echo $EMAIL_USER
echo $EMAIL_PASS

# Check console logs for errors
# Look for: "Email service not configured" or SMTP errors
```

### **Common Issues:**

**‚ùå "Email service not configured"**
- Check all EMAIL_* environment variables are set
- Restart your development server

**‚ùå "Authentication failed"**
- Verify your App Password is correct (16 characters)
- Make sure 2FA is enabled on your Google account
- Try generating a new App Password

**‚ùå "Connection timeout"**
- Check your firewall/network settings
- Verify EMAIL_HOST and EMAIL_PORT are correct
- Try using port 465 with secure: true

**‚ùå Emails going to spam**
- Add your domain to SPF records
- Set up DKIM signing
- Use a dedicated sending domain

## üìä **Admin Integration**

The email/password authentication integrates seamlessly with the existing admin system:

- **First User Setup**: First registered user can be promoted to admin
- **Admin User Management**: Admins can create email/password users
- **Role Management**: Email users get same role system as OAuth users
- **User Dashboard**: All authentication methods use same dashboard

---

## üîÑ **Migration from OAuth-Only**

If you're upgrading from OAuth-only authentication:

1. **No database changes needed** - uses existing storage system
2. **Existing users unaffected** - OAuth continues to work
3. **Admin users preserved** - existing admin roles maintained
4. **Gradual rollout** - can enable email auth alongside OAuth

---

## üöÄ **Production Deployment**

### **Environment Variables for Production:**
```bash
# Required for email auth
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=admin@yourdomain.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com

# Required for NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://yourdomain.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-production-secret

# Optional: Keep OAuth providers
AUTH_GITHUB_ID=your-github-id
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET=your-github-secret
AUTH_GOOGLE_ID=your-google-id
AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET=your-google-secret
```

### **DNS Configuration (Optional but Recommended):**
```
# Add SPF record to prevent emails going to spam
TXT @ "v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all"

# Add DMARC record for email security
TXT _dmarc "v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:admin@yourdomain.com"
```
